summary

'Here is a detailed summary of the software development meeting:<br><br>**Task Management**<br><br>* Ahmed (Backend Developer) completed most of the task management API, including endpoints for creating, editing, and deleting tasks. He is still working on the endpoint to assign tasks to multiple users and include deadline tracking.<br>* Sarah (Project Manager): The main focus of this sprint is finalizing the task management module.<br><br>**Notifications**<br><br>* Lina (Frontend Developer) integrated the new backend endpoints for user notifications, but there are issues with toast notifications disappearing too quickly. Suggestions were made to increase the default timeout and pause notifications when hovered.<br>* Decision: Allow both push and in-app notifications for due tasks, with user preferences for toggling.<br><br>**UX**<br><br>* Lina (Frontend Developer) finished the task list UI and implemented filtering by date, priority, and status.<br>* Noor (UX Designer) suggested standardizing confirmation prompts using a new modal component and awaiting explicit confirmation to reduce inconsistencies.<br>* Noor will design a settings page for user preferences, including enabling or disabling push notifications, daily summaries, and activity alerts.<br><br>**Performance**<br><br>* Ahmed (Backend Developer) added pagination and lazy loading on the notifications endpoint. Auto-archiving older notifications after 30 days was also discussed, with a plan to add an "Archived" tab in the notification center.<br><br>**Localization**<br><br>* Ahmed (Backend Developer) externalized all strings for the task and notification modules, ready for translation.<br>* Noor (UX Designer): Will sync with the translation vendor by Friday and share progress.<br><br>**Dark Mode**<br><br>* Lina (Frontend Developer) created base styles and variables for dark mode, awaiting color palette finalization from Noor (UX Designer).<br>* Target: Finish blockers by Wednesday to start the new sprint clean.<br><br>**Action Items and Decisions**<br><br>* Ahmed will add a filter to exclude deactivated accounts from assignment API responses.<br>* Lina will disable frontend dropdown entry as a backup.<br>* Omar (QA Engineer) will prioritize fixing the bulk delete issue.<br>* Sarah (Project Manager): Let\'s prioritize fixing the bulk delete issue, prevent deactivated users\' names from showing in the assignment dropdown, and document toast behavior changes.<br><br>**Jira Updates**<br><br>* Update Jira with meeting notes and tag dependencies.<br><br>'
