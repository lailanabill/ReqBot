It needs a safeguard. Also, assigning a task to a deactivated user doesn‚Äôt trigger any validation.Noor (UX Designer): Regarding the confirmation issue, I suggest we standardize all confirmation prompts with our new modal component and have them await confirmation explicitly. That should help reduce inconsistencies across different modules.Sarah: Good catch. Let‚Äôs prioritize fixing the bulk delete issue. Also, for deactivated users, can we prevent their names from even showing in the assignment dropdown?Ahmed: Yes, I‚Äôll add a filter to exclude deactivated accounts from the assignment API response. Should be a quick fix.Lina: That works. I‚Äôll also disable the frontend dropdown entry as a backup.Omar: Another thing ‚Äî some of the toast notifications are disappearing too quickly before users can read them, especially on slower machines.Noor: I‚Äôve had the same complaint from the UX review. We can increase the default timeout for toasts and make sure they pause when hovered.Sarah: Good. Let‚Äôs also document those toast behavior changes. We don‚Äôt want this to get lost in future sprints.Lina: I also want to mention the user notification system. I‚Äôve integrated the new backend endpoints, but we need a decision on whether to allow push notifications for due tasks or only show them inside the dashboard.Ahmed: The backend supports both now ‚Äî we can send push notifications using Firebase and store in-app messages in the user‚Äôs notification center.Sarah: Let‚Äôs go with both. But we need user preferences so they can toggle them.Noor: I‚Äôll design a settings page where users can enable or disable push notifications, daily summaries, and activity alerts. I‚Äôll share the prototype this afternoon.Sarah: Sounds good. What about performance concerns for users with thousands of notifications?Ahmed: I already added pagination and lazy loading on the notifications endpoint. But we can also auto-archive older notifications after 30 days unless they‚Äôre marked as important.Omar: Just make sure there‚Äôs a way for users to retrieve archived notifications if needed.Sarah: Great point. Let‚Äôs add an \"Archived\" tab in the notification center for now.Lina: I‚Äôll take care of that in the UI.Sarah: Any updates on localization?Ahmed: We‚Äôve externalized all strings for the task and notification modules. They're ready to be translated. I‚Äôve also added language headers to API responses so we can serve localized error messages.Noor: I‚Äôll sync with the translation vendor today and share progress by Friday.Sarah: One last thing. The client asked if we could support dark mode by next release.Lina: I‚Äôve already created the base styles and variables for it. I just need Noor to finalize the color palette.Noor: It‚Äôs almost done. I‚Äôll send it today.Sarah: Amazing. Let‚Äôs aim to finish all blockers by Wednesday so we can start the new sprint clean.
